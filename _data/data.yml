career-profile:
  title: Career Profile
  summary: |
    I am a PhD student in Statistics at Texas A&M with hands-on experience in predictive modeling, 
    uncertainty quantification, and Bayesian methods. My research focuses on developing and 
    applying Bayesian approaches for prevalence estimation, diagnostic accuracy evaluation, 
    and latent class modeling, with growing interest in applications to clinical trial 
    design and simulation-based inference.
