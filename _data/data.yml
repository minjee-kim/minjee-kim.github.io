career-profile:
  title: Career Profile
  summary: |
   PhD student in Statistics @ Texas A&M focused on
   Bayesian methods for prevalence estimation, diagnostic test evaluation,
   and latent class modeling. I am interested in extending these methods to
   clinical trial design and monitoring through reproducible simulation studies.
