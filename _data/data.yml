career-profile:
  title: Career Profile
  summary: |
    PhD student in Statistics at Texas A&M focused on
    Bayesian methods for prevalence estimation, diagnostic test evaluation,
    and latent class modeling. I am interested in extending these methods to
    clinical trial design and monitoring through reproducible simulation studies.
